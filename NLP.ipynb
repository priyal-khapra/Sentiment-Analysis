the schumacher films again i m also starting to become concerned about whether i m somehow subconsciously being contrarian you see i always liked the schumacher films as far as i can remember they were either s or s to me but the conventional wisdom is that the two tim burton directed films are far superior i had serious problems with the first burton batman this time around i ended up giving it a and apologize as i might i just couldn t help feel that batman returns just has too many small direction plot and script problems scattered throughout to justify a br br but burton almost trumps the problems with sheer force of style and even though there are a lot of small flaws batman returns is still a great film especially if you re a burton fan as batman returns has just as much in common with the nightmare before christmas and edward scissorhands as it does with anything else in the batman universe br br the film begins strongly with the cobblepots having a baby we see their dismay people walk out of the birthing room with horror on their faces ready to vomit later they have the baby in a small cage finally they take it out for an evening stroll and dump it in the gotham city river the baby ends up becoming batman villain the penguin danny devito br br meanwhile max shreck christopher walken is the film s evil capitalist comparable to grissom jack palance in batman he is planning on duping gotham city in various ways and we see him emotionally abusing his secretary the timid selina kyle michelle pfeiffer when kyle discovers one of the nefarious plots grissom tries to get rid of her but she is rescued by cats becoming catwoman br br while all of this is going on the penguin who has long been only rumored to exist and who is thought to be dangerous begins a scheme to be presented to the public as a good guy despite having less than benevolent ulterior motives br br before re watching burton s batman films this time i didn t remember just how little the films are about batman michael keaton it s almost as if burton didn t feel the character was interesting enough to focus on the focus here is much more on the villains especially the penguin batman doesn t appear very often especially in the beginning of the film and surprisingly often we re watching him watching the penguin br br although some viewers necessarily count the above as a flaw i can t say that i do even if i d like to know more about batman and follow his story more the villains stories are interesting too and as an origin story for two major batman villains batman returns is already more than complex in terms of plot br br however there are some character problems that i do count as a flaw the penguin has a cadre of circus performers who do his bidding but even though they re frequently on screen we never get to learn anything about them burton has a core of characters as intriguing as those in tod browning s freaks available with actors as interesting as vincent schiavelli but he just doesn t have the space to use them br br for that matter he hardly has space to explore catwoman the film plays as if catwoman may have been as developed and featured in as many scenes as the penguin but that cut of the film would have been hours long so the bulk of the catwoman scenes had to be excised of course all of this barely leaves any room for batman burton has batman turn very dark in the public s eye in this film and unusually he never bothers to resolve this as far as we know at the end gothamites still think that batman is a murdering lunatic that s an interesting development but unfortunately it ended up being dropped between this film and the next br br as for the script although there are minor problems including some non sequiturs and bizarre decisions in terms of logic made by characters it s clear that burton and writers sam hamm and daniel waters are not exactly trying to tell a traditional story a lot of the dialogue is pun oriented but often this is fairly subtle and or complex of course sometimes it is very blatant or transparent too it helps to look at batman returns as a more poetic film as i believe was the intention this also carries over into more general plot and directorial decisions plenty of odd character actions including from minor characters are done in service of a general mood or style and that style works very well br br dark is the easiest way to sum up batman returns in a word and whether that s a positive or negative depends on your disposition anyone who knows me knows that i love dark so for me burton s style largely transcends the flaws in the plot and the script in many ways batman returns is like an insane campy horror film with beautifully eerie production design like batman burton is still making many references to other films but instead of vertigo and star wars well there s still a slight star wars reference he invokes films like nosferatu including that max schreck was the name of the actor who played the dracula like character there motel hell the aforementioned freaks willy wonka and the chocolate factory which has a surreal dark edge to it and zombie films made most explicit in the penguin s final scene br br in terms of visuals and general atmosphere and that includes the general feel of the story the characters and so on this couldn t be a stronger',\n",

life a director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored it seems like a winning situation and then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence while it s entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project and it is only a very few times br br you know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics but then we start seeing new footage alternates from superman the movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away hey this is pretty neat things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from stm intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesn t convince at all and from this point on it never ever lets up it s probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was you ll believe a man can fly it s difficult to believe anything shown on screen here the best effects in this are from the original productions br br another issue with this re cut a lot of it just doesn t make sense the only reason any of it really works is because we ve all seen the theatrical version of superman ii a movie that does make sense lester s superman ii fills in the holes of this assembly part of this could be because donner didn t get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little lester material as possible what we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes superman iv look airtight and coherent br br after viewing this one gets the sense that while lester was faithful and comfortable using donner material michael thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by lester the best scenes in the donner cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of superman ii that includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by donner but anything else from that movie filmed by lester is re edited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing while lester honored the donner material lester here is thrown under the bus br br so is there anything good in this release well marlon brando is in it and that s neat to see in fact watching any of the material shot by donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as superman the movie but that only highlights the problems of this release any of the major scenes really just lois jumping and scenes with marlon brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions br br watch the opening scene at the daily planet why are we looking at jackie cooper s back as he calls for lois and clark at the end why do we have lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by jackie cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on i was initially confused by this because i expected to see lois the entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this br br battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts it s just random action of course the major action scenes were shot by lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of donner outtakes or alternates they should have used more of lester s footage but probably had too much pride to admit that br br the sloppiness extends to the military missile as well as noted elsewhere the missile shown in the donner cut bears the designation xk while we all know it s the xk a blind man in stm knows that the producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production for all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable br br the entire affair would probably be easier to digest if warner s didn t make this a separate release here in the states as it is we re expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a play all option it s really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing i expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else i know after my experience of watching this i had new respect for lester s version it s by no means perfect but lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief he managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new re cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history',\n",

going to say that robocop is any good frankly it pretty much sucks but as far as being a properly shot and executed film it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos yes the truth of the matter is that robocop is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near masterpiece so what if robocop turns robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy at least it s doing it openly i don t know where robocop begins and ends i don t know what or whom it s about i don t understand what s going on in it i don t understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren t i will go insane if i try to understand the characters i see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying i can t believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and i can t believe that irvin kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see he probably didn t by the way neither miller nor weller nor allen did it s not hard to see why br br now robocop has it s fans i know this mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti pretensions dismissing anybody who expected any depth or subject matter from the first film as academic roger ebert sith apprentices it s just a lot of fun a good piece of action and great entertainment the argument goes yeah well i guess if you just don t listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have arnold in the suit instead of weller don t get me wrong i like a good action film with pure entertainment value as it s only most satisfying virtue but robocop sir ain t no such thing br br look at the first couple of scenes this horrible actor makes robo repeat that he s just a machine and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man where after murphy s wife who s suing ocp for robot stalkings walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him and then is never heard of again i surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene because every one has these kind of absurdities in them it s like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay the characters act totally random and first say this then say that ocp wants to stop crime with a new robo especially this drug called nuke but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city politics are abandoned i guess understandable given the comic relief mayor the villain played by tom noonan who did a better version of this in last action hero and that s saying a lot is an addict but is still used for this machine the woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understand br br speaking of twelve year olds this film has the infamous role of hub this mad kid who swears and kills people played by a child actor i m not going to be all moral about it it s a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie go for it i don t know how much of frank miller s original vision was put into this but the credits at least acknowledge him as conceiver of the story and if i zoom out i could see this as being quite a cool character it s grim for sure to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of robocop and who would be surprised this whole business with the ocp trying to become this giant monopoly over everything is properly dystopian and good as well also the idea of robocop getting in touch with his wife and kid having them embedded into the story somehow would also be great and as far as i can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a robocop sequel br br but of course these are just ideas as many people have already said the screenplay is mess the kid has one scene the torture scene where it s hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol tin head why doesn t he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath isn t that what his character would do does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed not necessarily given that his last words are it sucks so why it really makes no sense and this can be said about everybody no everything in this film is there a strike in the police force is robocop machine or man what s the deal with turning robo into this community service machine for minutes i mean sure it s pretty funny i wouldn t deny that but why build it up and then discard it and why the hell is allen so criminally underused and what is it weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah well the threads are many and the mess is enormous br br this review is just as messed up as the film the only reason i give an extra star up

sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes the central romance is naively visualized but the sneaked in romantic moments between the to be married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressing br br v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice idealism of the about to be couple waiting to get married playing by the rules simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films sooraj sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage the union of families i think amrita rao looks very good she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the choti i e amrita prakash alok nath anupam kher shahid s bro sis in law it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya hahk hum saath saath hain the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesome br br stuff like sanctity in a marriage relationship avoiding courtship mutual respect care space waiting for getting married officially praying sacrficing for ur beloved all these and more get showcased in vivah there s still some good audience who r going enjoying this film some of the folks audience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arranged marriage thats success if you ask me it seems amrita rao our actress from vivah result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for hats off to her for this achievement chalo even though vivah shahid or amrita didn t get any of the film fare other awards least this is news to cheer about congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bride to be in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way shudn t forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar its no mean achievement congrats to amrita rao for taking her career to another level with this award i personally feel she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur they make a cute couple and their on screen chemistry reminds me of srk kajol or aamir khan juhi chawla br br some points that i observed few of the elements if u notice carefully amrita rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film perfect fit shahid kapur is like most of us not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage but prem listens carefully to the step wise talk given by his dad having full faith in anupam kher eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a st meet also its possible in the entire movie there are basically or sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together its unlike most other romantic wedding based movies where hero heroine are always singing dancing or nowadays doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these sequences characterized by restraint innocence respect for the other i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath amrita rao these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters girl kids in some parts of india romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely no cheap scenes songs are beautifully pictured words like jal praarthana e t c are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film last but not the least the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when shes struggling for life is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love i cant do without u its a hats off feeling br br in many ways vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya ddlj qayamat se qayamat tak hum dil de chuke sanam for the freshness on screen chemistry of the lead pair if u ask me along with films like rang de basanti lage raho munnabhai dor corporate and kabul

gleason they re all so horribly badly cast and overplayed as are most parts in the film you d happily kill them all off during the opening titles the villains fare no better with paul wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as captain seas scott walker no a different one delivering one of cinema s worst accents is it meant to be scottish irish welsh greek pakistani or some nationality no one has ever heard of while robyn hilton s marilyn monroe ish dumb blonde moll gives paris no relation a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes br br even with those drawbacks this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients lost tribes a pool of gold a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive all wrapped up in a quest to discover why doc s father was murdered unfortunately it s a question of tone in the s and s pulp superheroes weren t brooding figures prone to state of the art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought the films aimed purely at the matin e market you know for kids there have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight faced and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post production be it the colgate twinkle in doc s eye the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust up with captain seas or don black s gung ho lyrics to john philip sousa s patriotic marches but plenty was in the film to begin with after all it s hard to see how one of the villain s underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat while doc s explanation to pamela hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam west s batman instead the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional such as doc displaying his sixth sense by er bobbing his adam s apple br br perhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of new york skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them br br still aside from doc s various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously l a standing in for new york while fred koenekamp s cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget and it s good to see a superhero movie that doesn t spend most of its running time on an origin story though one is left with the suspicion that doc sprang fully formed from the loins of zeus himself br br it s a film i d really like to like more but it just feels like minutes of lost opportunities no wonder doc savage the arch enemy of evil the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits never happened',\n",

sooner br br being something of a film purist i tend to look at films for their artistic merits based upon dialog acting photography and even the efforts to remain true to the period in terms of costume ultimately i want to know if the film is truthful enough in revealing the human condition to make me think without oppressing me with what the director wants me to think br br fires on the plain is a great film because it crafts a portrait filled with realistic human reactions to the dying fires of a great historical catastrophe br br ichikawa s film is a condemnation of war on all levels as any good war film should be war is horrifying bloody destructive it is also murderous on the psyche however what is fundamental about fires on the plain is its unapologetic look at the japanese soldiers it shows them slowly collapsing under the weight of superior american firepower and their nation s inability to wage a war of its own making a fatalistic code encouraging death before surrender is at the heart of this madness br br i was astonished to see such an honest and brutally close look at the bitter fruits of japan s military misadventure made just years after the end of what the japanese call the great pacific war ichikawa reveals what the germans called the war life the plight of the common soldier br br ichikawa s film is interesting since even today japan is having a hard time fully coming to terms with its wartime fanaticism its subjugation of conquered peoples the racism of its war against the chinese and war crimes which included cannibalism by soldiers and officers practiced not only against one another but against allied prisoners of war br br ichikawa produces a stark representation of the victimization of soldiers by a confluence of bad political decisions and cultural pressures br br this stark examination is skillfully done by portraying the doomed soldiers as human beings who exhibit at various times fear brilliantly laconic humor dialog enriched by its sparseness and a plot whose complexity is belied by the grim wilderness setting br br ichikawa s portrait is a ragged and painful tapestry of defeated men the tubercular tamura played as a woebegone and gentle soul by eiji funakoshi is a good soldier who can t abandon his humanity though he is as frightened and lost as his comrades before he departs for a hospital that will reject him as too healthy tamura is given a hand grenade by a superior who recognizing the hopelessness of their situation advises tamura to kill himself br br why tamura s hopelessly ill supplied and militarily incapable unit was not ordered to surrender at the start of the film is telling ichikawa makes it plain that the war is over and everyone is merely waiting to die as tamura leaves his unit for his hopeless search for physical and spiritual salvation he sees his comrades pointlessly digging an air raid shelter they appear like corpses looking up from their own mass grave br br we later watch as the overworked hospital s medical staff abandons the dying patients to an all consuming american artillery barrage the pathetic patients who crawl from their huts in a vain attempt to survive appear like pathetic serpentine creatures dragging themselves from an omnipotent force you know they won t survive br br ichikawa makes it plain that the only thing worse than a defeated army is one that has lost its honor by abandoning its humanity and its comrades as tamura staggers through the jungles of leyte we encounter the noble the dying and the exploitive cannibalism rears its ugly head as soldiers begin to eat one another rather than surrender to american corned beef br br when the men do talk of surrender the propaganda of how americans kills prisoners is countered by a worldly wise soldier who reveals that the approaching americans feed and care for prisoners of war because they unlike the japanese respect brave soldiers who are forced to give up br br it is the japanese who intend to die fighting for the emperor long after resistance has lost all meaning those willing to fight to the death will be killed it is the calculus of war br br after shooting a murderous and cannibalistic comrade whom he earlier offered his own body to as food the fatalistic tamura s careless surrender also seems to be an intentional form of suicide his death is a lonely image was ichikawa trying to tell us of the internal conflict of the ordinary soldier who wants to live but who is still trapped by his nation s suicidal cultural codes br br if someone watches this film carefully he or she will see that absolutism and fanaticism is the enemy the americans are portrayed as a technologically advanced people willing to employ that technology in the form of inexorable military power a lesson that transformed japanese postwar society ichikawa s film isn t so shallow that it indicts america ichikawa indicts the sedimentary layers of japan s destructive policies that created the war and then to continue it when all was lost br br ichikawa does not mention the nuclear weapons dropped upon nagasaki and hiroshima he doesn t have to the slow motion destruction of the

hair a central character who has a jaw line resembling a house brick can be stabbed twice have his hands covered in acid this acid can eat it s way through steel trapdoors but is kept in a ceramic jug

for bad film fans those with a taste for the different bizarre on the disappointing side lionman only gets his steel claws minutes before the end which is a shame br br director bayten certainly keeps things moving along at a brisk pace although it s far from well made during the opening battle one moment guys are fighting on a sand dune the next their on a grassy hill with trees in the background there is one point where lionman uses a branch to pole vault but it s obviously just a long tube with a vine wrapped around it then there s the scene when a bloodthirsty pack of bloodhounds are supposed the chasing lionman down but the dogs used are obviously different breeds including some of the most harmless looking dogs ever there are just so many individual scenes in aslan adam that are just hilarious stupid bizarre or all three that i could go on forever just check the ending out when lionman is jumping flying about everywhere like he can fly there s lots of blood in aslan adam although not much actual graphic gore or violence a few stabbings someone has their hands cut off is as graphic as it gets br br technically aslan adam is pretty ropey the period costumes are bright garish featuring purples yellows reds various other bright colours the fight scenes are cheap but at least the filmmakers tried to put as much action in as they could the music seemed like it was more suited to a classical ballet rather than an action film is yet another bizarre aspect to aslan adam the acting was bad even dubbed you could tell the acting was bad br br aslan adam is pure gold from

take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material verow fairly rolls around in it judging from what he s done since then he s well suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it vacationland a would be teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and i m disappointed i have to report that br br first off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing when we later meet a man who is supposed to be joe s teacher it s confusing as the sweaty faced guy looks much younger than the student he s teaching joe s mother looks younger than he does and doesn t act any older either second in joe s opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasn t working it was weird br br it s minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men s toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a rite of passage for our young hero one minute joe is nervously trying his hand at bathroom stall sex a scene so un erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute he s an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double crossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character we ll later learn is andrew and that s about all we learn about him other than he s apparently gay but not out yet br br there s a lot crammed in to the running time which is about minutes too long i can t imagine how it played with the mind numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a sub plot copped from gods and monsters with an aged patron who spouts rhetoric appros pos of nothing played by an actor who obviously can t remember his lines he is conveniently dispatched with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mix n match almost four way between the boys and their girlfriends a gay bashing toilet tramp a would be wise sage in the form of a nellie queen and hasn t the nellie queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired stereo type who exists only to be degraded blackmail theft murder alcohol consumption and abuse of looping music software for soundtrack recording br br what you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots we re expected to imagine we re in an airport grocery store office and classroom as all the scenes in these locations consist of close ups and poorly edited soundscapes to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either it s the worst bar in the world or there are only about gay men in bangor maine as the bar never has any patrons in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn t coming from the speakers but was just more of the droning loop music of the score br br plots and characters come and go emotions are unreadable and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is film speak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we aren t given any information about these characters it s impossible to care about what happens to them it s as if joe et al appear out of the ether one day and might simply cease to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of joe s sister a wannabee jennifer grey who is bohemia crazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem is but again does it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hi def video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching sctv s parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their noses were stuck together for the whole scene br br one senses verow is really restraining himself from making a naughtier or somewhat rougher movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldn t have held back the frothy toothpaste sex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie he produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like herschell gordon lewis directed films without gore porn films without sex in them i got some unintended laughs out of this and it wasn t boring it just wasn t very good either',\n",

know how movies that are supposed to be serious but turned out so awful that you have to laugh out loud and watch them again like lionheart an old van damme film or john carpenter s vampires are pretty cool this film ironheart manages to be neither of those i don t know what the filmmakers were thinking but it looks as if this movie was made with no time to shoot no budget for anything and no script to speak of while i m on the script note i should point out that bolo yeung has no lines in this movie the only reason he gets first billing on the box is the fact that he s the only actor in the film that you ll ever recognize unless you re a jackie chan fan in which case you ll recognize the bad guy and you ll want to call him giancarlo br br what s also sad is that this film is from by that time t judgment day had come out so you know that the era of s campiness was over but not quite after this you ll think s chuck norris films high school comedies and jason freddy sequels were works of sheer genius br br things to know br br nobody in this film can act for beans the closest you get is richard norton looking appropriately rich and cocky and bolo yeung looking appropriately mean and cocky everything else is dreadful br br the martial arts scenes are forgettable just many instances of white guys with lots of muscles taking off their shirts yelling running at britton lee getting kicked by britton lee getting punched by britton lee then falling down even the final showdown against bolo is disappointingly short and about as creative as the design of my running socks and equally stinky br br the rest of the action is pathetic too the guns look like they came from the toy department at k mart and indeed they fire with the sound of a capgun when someone gets shot they bounce around a little bit then lie still with splotches of brownish red liquid on their clothes britton lee apparently gets shot in the side but you don t see it at all then later that day you see the wound i ve had paper cuts that were worse than that br br of course then the girl dresses the wound then they kiss then next thing you know they re lying in bed talking after sex huh what believable development of the love interest as well as any kind of character development at all are overlooked completely in this film remember how bruce lee s characters didn t need to have sex with anybody to be cool br br the car chase is by far the worst i ve ever seen it looks like the director was sitting on the curb with a hand held camera as the two cars weaved down the road doing oh i don t know about miles an hour don t try this at home kids these people are professionals hah br br really bad writing here s a scene for you lee is being followed so the girl follows the followers to warn lee but her car is too slow so by the time she catches up lee and the bad guys are out of their cars and there s a gunfight in progress lee has killed two bad guys but the third is shooting at lee when the girl almost runs lee over so the bad guy runs away huh then the girl s car stalls and she can t start it she tells lee she s involved now and she s coming with him he points out to her that they can t leave her car there because the bad guys will trace it to her she somehow convinces him that he should decide how to deal with this problem so he shoots the gas tank and blows up her car and remember later that same night they have sex huh br br if you look closely in more than half of the nightclub shots the dancers are very much out of sync with the music the dancers are also all way too co ordinated with each other apparently in the s all people at dance clubs took dancing lessons there is a girl in the dj booth with a microphone but she never does anything except dance the bouncers tell people who are fighting to take it outside without moving their lips in one scene the only bouncers lee and stevo pass by are just inside the entrance but with their backs to it also apparently if you re a major character in the film you can go straight to the head of the line br br lee notices the first time he is being followed but he doesn t notice the second time even though it s the same guy in the same car the girl however notices bad guys get followed twice but they never notice br br lee is worried the bad guys will trace the girl s car back to her even though they have already seen him show up where she works twice the girl proceeds to leave her child at work in the care of a friend while she is off having sex with lee do not learn parenting from this film br

              " 'inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last years werner herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker i ve been acquainted with herzog for a few decades now and i ve never not been impressed by both the man and his work last year i went to see rescue dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was yet couldn t help but imagine herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film but to live it no other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the film making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend br br today i sat down to fata morgana a herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard without researching the actual locations i m assuming it was shot somewhere in africa both coastal and desert a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man infant civilization infant life on earth it is these origins the biblical notion of the garden of eden and the apocalypse that herzog is concerned with as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the minute run time br br watching fm i couldn t help but feel i was a passenger on a profound journey in the opening sequence the title is translated as mirage and herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip these images are perverted their dimensionality crushed flat by a long lens piling layers of exhaust heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another the effect left me to conclude things are not as they seem br br fm is divided into very distinct chapters creation paradise and the golden age chapter one opens with countless languid images where bleak barren landscapes scroll by dead animals rot broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun the people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert the narration talks of a time before life a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens while the narration hearkens to a simpler purer era a portrait of a young boy holding a fox like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man s cruel ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature br br in the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality we listen to a goggled biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment as he holds the squirming monitor its tongue flicking at flies he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the searing degree heat the parallel is duly noted and herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm he also pushes forward the theme that if not in control man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways br br the last chapter takes us out of the desert s blast furnace and into the more familiar herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior no one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than herzog possibly this is where he feels most at home much like errol morris herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll the subsequent flirtation herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut as morris does this extended roll pushes past the on moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime their facade gives way to something real the most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the person band playing an odd polka like song that herzog recycles throughout this chapter the drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist as does another guy doing a magic trick begging the question what s with the goggles they definitely add some levity to the film but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance or is this just another example of herzog s playfullness br br the narration aside herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary s soundtrack leonard cohen grabs the most screen time two of his beautifully melancholic songs so long marianne and suzanne perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride by the end of the journey herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon despite the overall bleakness of fm the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit belief that against all odds life will persevere and possibly even flourish br br having finished writing this post i referenced fm to discover that herzog shot it in saharan cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup true to his legend herzog and his crew were arrested beaten and imprisoned while imprisoned herzog fell ill with schistosomiasis a blood parasite it s truly hard not to love such a

auditoriums of the cinema the presence of a radio in just about everyone s house hold kept depression era america at once attuned to world s events and provided many a drama and especially comedy shows for a pleasant interlude from harsh reality br br the literature of the time also flourished at all levels the juvenile reading habits helped to create the comic book as we know it what with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures but the comic book just did not magically appear all fully developed with all the colorful color pages all by itself there were mediums that were ancestral to them obviously the newspaper comic strip was one parent providing the visual narrative method of story telling br br the other direct ancestor was the pulp magazine the inexpensive prose story publications that carried a great deal of stories of the same adventure characters in on going though not necessarily serialized tales the pulp medium had been around for some decades and introduced us to edgar rice borrough s tarzan and johnston mcculley s zorro the s brought forth a bumper crop as feature characters like the shadow the avenger g s battle aces and the spider master of men all found their way to the news stands among many others br br one other was doc savage a full blooded super hero of the written story the covers of the pulps had perhaps the only picture of the hero possessing extraordinary strength super keen senses and a protean genius class intellect doc was the prototype super hero br br he also assembled of his former army buddies into a small free lancing team of adventurers each of them was an expert in a given field so we had a top rated chemist lawyer construction engineer electrical engineer geologist archaeologist paleontologist etc br br the doc savage stories were very popular in the s and s and were published into the middle s then they went into a hiatus for a good years then the brainstorm came about to repackage the old novels in new container the paperback book a fresh look to the cover art was introduced featuring a highly stylized series of paintings of a very muscular doc with a perpetually ripped shirt br br the re introduction proved to be highly successful with the publication of a title a month and for a while more soon there was a rumor of a doc savage movie but when by what producer well the venerable man of bronze was back on the news stands for over years before any real project got put together it was veteran stop action animator and producer of top special effects films geoprge pal who did the film along with warner brothers br br when doc savage man of bronze arrived in the movie houses it boasted of a well casted team of actors albeit a largely no name as far familiarity with the viewers with former tarzan of tv ron ely s nearly perfect casting in the lead up and coming beauty of a starlette pamela hensley in the female lead and veteran character paul wexler as the villainous captain seas no other name would have been recognized and just maybe that was a plus in this case br br the story does a fine job of both getting most of the audience acquainted with the incredible group and at the same time get a plot going use of narration by paul frees and short film clips are the method pursued to move the introduction along to the main body of the story br br from the very start there are hints that this story will go with the same sort of manufactured camp humor as the batman tv series some really great looking early scenes involving doc and the whole crew doing their individual specialties are thrown toward humor by the paul frees narration and the unexpected unlikely outcomes for example an experiment of doc s with a miniature rocket missile turns out to be part of a method of catching fish a small one at that the whole story unfolds like that hitting the viewer with a little camp every so often as to keep reminding us not to take it too seriously we are also puzzled about mr george pal s being the producer his last he who had been so well known for special effects surely a factor that could be put to good use in a sci fi action setting of the pulp character s world br br i can remember seeing it quite vividly mrs ryan deanna was in the hospital just having given birth to our nd child michelle our older girl jennifer was visiting her grandmother so after visiting hours were over in the maternity ward it was straight over to the old marquette theatre rd kedzie here in chicago br br having seen it and being a guy with a good familiarity with doc i was sort of let down by the final product i could accept a little of this camp business but would not have objected if mr pal would have seen fit to let it all hang out and have some real neat dinosaurs and volcanoes to give it all a little more pulp comic serial type excitement br br and yet the cast headed up by mr ely and the others made the whole film likable if not lovable the sets and locations were as far as we can see very much like those of a s serial or adventure flick which would be enjoyable to about anyone br br and maybe that s just what they were trying for with this doc savage man

temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle like bebe daniels did in nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film like most race films keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles the music dressing styles you ll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood it would of had better scenery better filming and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheaux s films swing is the best the movie features singers dancers actresses and actors who were popular but forgotten today doli armena a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky the sexy hot female dancer consuela harris would put ann miller and gyspy rose lee to shame br br adding further info popular blues singer of the s and s cora green is the focus of the film she s mandy a good hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women a nosy neighbor played by amanda randolph tells mandy what she seen and heard and mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive curvy woman by the name of eloise played hazel diaz a hot cha entertainer in the s and a fight breaks out then mandy goes to harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies dorothy van engle lena provides mandy with a home a job and helps her become a star when temperamental cora smith played by hazel i guess she s playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior when cora gets drunk and breaks her leg lena convinces everyone that mandy is right for the job and lena is right and a star is born in mandy tall long lanky but handsome carman newsome is the cool aspiring producer who lena looks out for as well pretty boy larry seymour plays the no good man but after lena threatens him he might shape up there are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where cora smith hazel diaz struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that s not enough she almost gets into a fight with mandy again in between there s great entertainment by chorus girls tap dancers shake dancers swing music and blues singing there s even white people watching the entertainment i wonder where micheaux found them there s even a scene where there s blacks and whites sitting together at the club micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films he should be commended for such a bold move br br this movie was the first race film i really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to oscar micheaux this movie is one of the best of the race film genre its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business br br no these early race films may not be the best can t be compared with hallelujah green pastures stormy weather cabin in the sky carmen jones or any other hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person s eyes these films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life be beautiful classy and elegant and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in hollywood most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren t the best but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time micheaux and spencer williams couldn t afford nina mae mckinney josephine baker ethel waters fredi washington paul robeson rex ingram and more of the bigger stars so micheaux and other black and white race film makers would use nightclub performers in their movies some were good some weren t great actors and actresses but i think micheaux and others knew most weren t good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent they just wanted their stories told and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films for some true actors actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work especially if they didn t want to play hollywood stereotypes so i think you ll be able to spot the true actors actresses from the nightclub performers these race films are very historic they could have been lost forever many are lost maybe race films aren t the greatest example of cinema but even hollywood films didn t start out great in the beginning i think if the race film genre continued it would have better if your looking for great acting most race films aren t the ones but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films than watch race films there are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast moon over harlem body and soul paradise in harlem

us sitting no more than or feet away from him now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where i got really worked up the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no one else he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia s greatest kick boxer he said that he wasn t a sell out he was happy and a retiree he wasn t ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing then he plugged his film yes you heard right he plugged his new film as he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty minute clip of this vile

subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever and the most over choreographed fight scenes that didn t even remotely reflect stan s actual talent in kickboxing the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous dermot brereton mark chopper read and greg matthews the whole time you re sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background too bad the movie relies heavily on split second appearances by former celebrities remember those plot holes i told you about ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife now we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film and then leave it for buggery this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up then get this at the end it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn t actually dead but was sold into prostitution do we see her no does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this no now that s a marriage br br amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as a cross between jackie chan guy ritchie has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film chan shows more dexterity taking a

its making br br what s surprising and disappointing about waqt is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clich s of hindi cinema in his first venture but who in his second outing gives in for all the stereotype film formulas while vipul shah had the conviction to show something as implausible as blind men robbing a bank in aankhen he just fails to induce life in the entire packaging of waqt that is based on something as conceivable as a father son relationship adopted from a gujarati play aavjo vhala fari malishu waqt does have a sensible storyline with a social message to back up a mature look on the father son relationship a father s unconditional love towards his son and a son s responsibility towards his family ishwar chand sharawat amitabh bachchan who has established his entire empire on his own from the scratch leads an affluent life with his wife sumitra shefali shah their only son aditya akshay kumar never had the need to strive for anything

leading a carefree life br br the endurance limit finally collapses when ishwar expels aditya from his house the sudden change in the attitude of his affectionate father towards him and his now expecting wife baffles aditya he has no option left but to strive for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn kid he starts turning into an independent man but the rift in the relationship between him and his father grows br br the story is simplistic while the uncomplicated screenplay has a very elementary approach one can easily identify and relate with the credible characters of both the father and the son if you are not one of the two you at least might have come across individuals like them somewhere in real life br br add to it director vipul shah s easy handling of the screenplay with a family affair like this any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings as per the cinematic laws of bollywood family dramas turning the film into a compulsive tearjerker however shah excels in the effortless handling of emotions for most part of the film br br clear cut example of his unpretentious direction is palpable in the pre interval scene where the father expels the son from his house in a rather frivolous manner the purpose of the scene is achieved without blotting a brunt on the audiences brains ditto for the scene in the second half wherein the now separated father son have a flippant conversation that s what differentiates waqt from a kabhi kushi ghum or an ek rishtaa and in fact places it one level high in terms of treatment br br but after gaining all the distinction points one may wonder where does waqt still fail in the problem lies in the fact that while waqt distinguishes itself from the others in it s league in terms of treatment it gives in to the glitches in the terms of packaging what with the director forcing in song n dance every now and then in the first half there s a johar kinda shaadi song a chopra kinda holi song a father son disco dandia song a dream song and a dream come true song inducing sufficient yawns in the viewer picture this the father has just ousted the son from his house and the son is dreaming of a song in moroccan mountains with his wife out of place out of reason and the audience out of seat br br the film just drags in the first half and the actual story starts only in the second half the director has wasted too much waqt on unnecessary elements the much talked about dog chase sequence isn t bad but is not redeeming either however akshay kumar s taandav dance is simply ridiculous imagine he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this unintentionally hilarious histrionic add to it the climax set at the finals of the star hunt where the son bursts out with emotions that s so archetypal also the editing pattern could have been reversed to conceal the father s reason for the change in attitude towards his son br br anu malik s music is fine though unnecessary in the proceedings santosh thundiiayil s camera work is competent enough though not much demanding aatish kapadia has come up with some good dialogs for dramatic moments br br boman irani and rajpal yadav make up or the light moments in the film very efficiently while rajpal yadav has been going overboard with his comic histrionics in many films off lately this time he underplays his character and is completely restrained his deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with boman s over the top histrionics br br shefali shah is convincing in the mother s role not to be taken as a censure but she is flawless in both playing and looking her character priyanka is gorgeous and performs her part well br br of course the major applause deserves are akshay kumar and amitabh bachchan akshay is especially expressive in the scene where his doting father intentionally berates him to make him aware of his responsibilities though bachchan goes a bit dramatic in a couple of scenes his brilliance strikes throughout the film br br to sum up waqt is like a soup whose ingredients are both tasty and nutritional but the final recipe somehow isn t as much appetizing',\n",

my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away and isn t that just par for the course i had the chance to revisit this film and found that it still stands up quite well although it s not quite the success that memory had painted br br i have to confess to a certain bias here some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson lovers others as jackson haters i m not exactly either i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note perfect for the radio three years later br br i must say however that where i found jackson s films an increasingly indulgent disappointment the bakshi version for all that it has been cut to the bone is actually more accurate yes there are the usual understandable changes here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action the only exception to the latter as others have remarked is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell where the ringwraiths having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid flight which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop which is initially nightmarish but pointless plot wise and definitely goes on too long i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory due partly to bad animation and that gandalf windmills his arms too much br br but having watched both approaches to the film i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is half myth oddly enough one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn s story of beren and luthien the extreme literalism required by live action filming where everything from monsters to mail shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera is counter productive latex faced or cgi monsters are less monstrous than sketchily drawn shapes heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies and hobbits or dwarfs with non human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods with its crippled half human movements as one of the scariest moments in the film it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark br br the extreme stylisation of the introduction plus a voice over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back story in a few sentences works very well to depict an almost mythical era and the change to the comic book rusticism of the shire i particularly like the proudfeet corresponds effectively to the similar change in tone of tolkien s prose i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect gandalf threatening bilbo with his true power in the opening scenes bilbo seeming to become a gollum like creature under the influence of ring lust at rivendell and galadriel s famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight where it would have been trivial to distort the scene to reflect the hobbits changed perceptions but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette firelight hues at bree bright colours re emerging at rivendell and in the fangorn clearing dirty greys and browns for moria and the desolate lands work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes where a live action approach simply doesn t allow you to blur the background or sketch in a stylised setting br br as a fan i didn t care for either jackson s or bakshi s depiction of lothlorien again i feel that the radio soundscape was the best evocation i ve come across of a beautiful slightly uncanny woodland paradise caught out of time and i feel that bakshi got the elven singing at this point pretty badly wrong but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their travails in moria aragorn giving a hobbit fencing lesson here is as charming and equally uncanonical a spectacle as boromir engaging with the hobbits in hollin in the jackson version br br the depiction of aragorn as convincingly weatherworn ranger is good throughout this film viggo mortensen s scruffy jesus look really didn t work for me although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to clean up the character in the second half for gondor s benefit john hurt unsurprisingly gives a sterling vocal performance as does a resonant william squire in the part of gandalf the hobbits are i suspect intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience identification figures i find the animated style their proportions are much more cartoonish than those of the human characters works well to

boromir as viking he was always a fairly bludgeoning type than to beardy aragorn illogical they were both numenorians after all although i am clearly in a minority here br br the big flaw in this

              " 'a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a children s film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults takashi miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the children s fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war br br the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined what follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore but wait there s also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world however the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demon spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate resentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals those whove played the video game sonic the hedghog might remember a certain dr robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly s who sonic had to then liberate br br the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans of course in this magical world of miike s yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them br br in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children s fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party the yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival and even then only to dance and party also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all s well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die this ending with it s yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon s pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of over consumption the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformed br br this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to and i believe it shows as there s a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness though i ve focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off i do want to say that visually it s a kaleidescope of cgi stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well there s a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either the yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who i believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a children s film however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more often br br all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performances the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn t come close to his apex instant classic',\n",

and little blond asthmatic kuba adam misik the poem is much in evidence but the theme it gets a little lost br br marcela anna geislerov the beauty and jarda roman lukn r have lost everything in the prague floods of and have nothing left it seems but good sex which they go at with such a vengeance in their tiny apartment that lucina and kuba in front of the telly must hold their ears against the noise hrebejek relishes such explicitness and skates on the edge of embarrassment or shock there s no good explanation precisely why but financial desperation has led jarda to processing stolen cars in the big garage that adjoins his flatlet his car thief cohort drives off a posh volvo the easygoing benes josef abrham has left with the keys in the ignition while visiting a large property he owns benes is a super nice guy but no fool his volvo is wired for tracking by satellite in cases like this and that leads the cops straight to jarda s garage and he and his cohort are off to jail br br beauty in trouble flees to the good angel on whom she can rely begins the graves poem but actually this fracas leads benes to marcela when he meets her at the police station he introduces her to sushi and how to drink wine and plies her with a picture book about tuscany where he though prague born owns a lovely villa and has lived most of his life he s here to reclaim the house in prague now occupied by a couple with an ancient and infirm mother whom he allows to remain benes every gesture is benevolent even though he doesn t prevent jarda from going off to jail br br in the circumstances marcela must retreat with lucina and kuba to depend on the charity of her mother zdena jana brejchova and the far less tender mercies of zdena s present husband the scrawny diabetic richard hrstka jiri schmitzer who for the kids starting when they commit the cardinal sin of consuming his dietetic cookies proves to be the uncle from hell jiri schmitzer hijacks the film at this point and never quite lets it go even in the final scene he is a figure of leering menace it is surprising that the obnoxious richard doesn t sexually abuse one or both of the children he is insistent that marcela needs to get out on her own and when benes offers to take her under his wing he and richard become improbable allies improbable perhaps implausible why should benes like him but then what is benes s whole story about some things the film gives too much information and about others not enough br br clearly the good angel benes is infallibly kind and a polished good looking older man whose manners befit his italian upbringing it s only at the end when he s pushed to the limits over his prague property by the devious occupants he proves that he is not one to won t lie down and be walked over br br also to be dealt with is jarda s religious fanatic mother sdena jana brejchova and her interactions with zdena and richard are something to watch but she is just another wild card that does not augment the deck br br the poem has been set to music in a czech translation and is sung on screen by the accordionist vocalist raduza first in a tiny scene then in a more extended one staged at a prison performance witnessed by jarda and the car thief pal if you revere hrebejk as an auteur you may relish this sequence otherwise it tends to feel gratuitous also included are a number of songs by glen hansard marketa irglova of the oscar award winning irish musical film once including the latter s theme song falling they feel more out of place than they would otherwise because of their familiarity from once though this film came first br br hrebejk s people are arresting even little koba has his shakespearean child moments and a wealth of charm but the director and his writer seem unable to resist the temptation to digress and to over expand the property hassle benes endures may be useful for showing he has a tough side but such an elaborate demonstration wasn t necessary the acting is fine and there is a wonderful with quirkiness and specificity but the basic themes of love sex and money get lost in the shuffle and marcela s conflicts and how she resolves them never become clear it s fine that there is no resolution and true to the theme and to graves s poem that marcela still has hot sex with jarda during a revisit to prague after moving to tuscany with benes and her kids but there are too many questions remaining about what to make of the obnoxious richard or of jarda s annoyingly pious mother em lia v s ryov how come all of a sudden we learn koba is

              " 'i couldn t believe this terrible movie was actually made at all with the worst actors you could find the worst script written mark frost sollace mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing i won t belabor the story as it s really not worth it but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story as to the story it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did that in reality the wife couldn t defend herself against a little bitty of a thing that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up and the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie codes and the male species the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim hard to believe that sollace mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this dribble br br as to the acting jordan ladd the killer is awful a loony toons who does needlepoint during her murder trial is this allowed in court she bored me to the hilt one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and i d throw up she s not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife the husband played on one level by vincent spano just seems to look and act stupid most of the time he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice if she would cross examine me anytime i d have told her to go take a hike everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so br br i wish i could give this film a zero rating however we are forced to start with too bad let s not have anymore painful watching films like this lifetime can do better then this i know it br br this is a postscript made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew i d seen it before and didn t like it or her i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick doesen t anyone see that her his message is that sickness pays being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director writer totally making the male species idiots well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful we re not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this person s mind deserves to be trashed br br and again this loser is shown why can t you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again get her off tv films and out of sight she s just terrible in every sense of the word phew',\n",

              " 'reading web sites on bette davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting i even found a site which claimed that bette davis success was probably due to her luck but ms davis films of tell quite the opposite the most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart fog over frisco and on human bondage characters she played in these movies though both being negative are quite different arlene in the former is a beautiful glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than mildred in the latter which is a pale uneducated and impudent cockney waitress needless to say that ms davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm but even that is not all the point is that the former role which would be wished by most actresses of the day was the one she was forced to play the latter role which seemed to most actresses as undesirable career destroying role was the one she fought for ferociously for months and it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars so there is no question that ms davis knew from the start what she was doing br br the film which tells about a medical student phillip carey leslie howard which falls unhappily in love with cockney waitress mildred rogers bette davis has a few week points but many more strong ones the story is simply too big to be told in mere minutes for example it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place well there is one scene in which we are exposed to ms davis captivating eyes but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved nevertheless the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from howard and davis as well as fantastic steiner s music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters faces in fact the film is amalgamated by phillip s walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering two tone repetition every detail is well thought max steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in phillip s life which is consistently used through the film and a beautiful scene in which we see sally s face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes i ve ever seen exactly due to francis dee s breathtaking beauty ms dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in gone with a wind as well as steiner s captivating music camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing br br but my strongest objection is that events are presented too two dimensionally which induce viewer that mildred is an ultimate slut the most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her but they curiously finished portrayed as likable characters after all mildred always in her own specific but still a honest way lets phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him which he just refuses to hear it is phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem he is enslaved to his club foot as much as to mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life of course selfish and impudent mildred after discovering voluntary phillip s bondage to her did its own share to make his life hell even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen it is less than clear why would she burn phillip s money maugham intended different in his novel after all she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagne br br for modern standards the film is a bit outdated but each subsequent time you watch it you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting fascinating music and original editing so it does deserve the highest possible mark',\n",
